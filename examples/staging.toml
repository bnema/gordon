# Staging workflow:
# 1. Developer pushes feature branch
# 2. CI builds and tags: company-app:feature-auth  
# 3. CI pushes: docker push staging-registry.company.com/company-app:feature-auth
# 4. Gordon auto-deploys to feature-auth.company.com
# 5. Team tests at https://feature-auth.company.com
# 6. Merge to staging → auto-deploy to staging.company.com
